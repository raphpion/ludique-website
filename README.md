# Ludique Website

I am mostly creating this project to challenge myself. I've been working with WordPress for a little time and am slowly merging towards newer stacks / libraries.

I want to get a better understanding of concepts like routing, account management, content management with a stack that I am at ease with. This is my first jump towards full stack development.

Feel free to reuse. Hope you enjoy!
